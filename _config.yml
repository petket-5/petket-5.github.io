 Hi, my name is Peter Kettig, I'm an engineer passionate about space and astronautics. I have been working on developing computer-vision algorithms and full-scale spacecraft ground segments dedicated to earth observation for the past five years.
 My recent project brought me to monitor climate change and its imapacts on mankind using a variety of space-borne data within the framework of the [Space for Climate Observatory (SCO)](https://www.spaceclimateobservatory.org).

 I enjoy working in a highly technological field and building processing chains that help to better understand the underlying data - I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks (including AI ones) and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new.
 Currently,

          I am currently working at CNES as an engineer for the department of earth observation. My roles are a) leading the development of the Data Processing Unit (DPU) of the MicroCarb satellite, dedicated to monitoring CO2-emissions.
          Within the DPU, there are multiple processing levels that help to translate the raw data into usable scientific measurements and correct for artifacts in the acquisition chain, from Level-0 (raw, compressed CCSDS packets) to Level-3 (Global CO2 maps).
          As is common in space projects and space agencies in particular, I am coordinating multiple companies that each intervene with their own expertise to help building the ground segment.
          When I am not taking care of MicroCarb, I spend most of my time in a more downstream-oriented project, called FloodDAM, that aims at monitoring floods and their impact and risk assesment on humans.
          The project is a joint collaboration of laboratories and industry partners, that leverages satellite and on-ground data from various sources: Optical- and SAR-Imagery, Altimetry, gauge-station networks etc. It is part of the Space for Climte Observatory initative (SCO).

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
